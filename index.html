    <h2>Introduction to Sacraments</h2>
    <p>A sacrament is a sacred and visible sign instituted by Christ to give grace. In the Catholic Church, there are seven sacraments, and each one acts as a channel of divine grace and strengthens our bond with God. These sacraments are rooted in Scripture and tradition. Jesus either instituted or affirmed each sacrament during His earthly ministry. For instance, Baptism is supported by Matthew 28:19, the Eucharist by Luke 22:19, Confession by John 20:23, Confirmation by Acts 8:17, Anointing of the Sick by James 5:14, Holy Orders by John 20:21, and Matrimony by Mark 10:9. These references reveal how the sacraments are not mere customs but part of God’s plan of salvation. Grace is God’s free gift that enables us to live holy lives. Through the sacraments, we receive sanctifying grace, which strengthens our relationship with God, helps us grow in virtue, and unites us with the Christian community.</p>

    <h2>Sacraments of Initiation</h2>
    <p>Baptism marks the beginning of Christian life and the cleansing of original sin. It is based on Matthew 3:13–17, where Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River. Symbols include water, a white garment, a candle, and oil. Today, Baptism is often given to infants but is also available to adults through the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.</p>
    <p>The Eucharist involves receiving the Body and Blood of Christ, based on Luke 22:19–20. The bread and wine become the real presence of Jesus. The Eucharist remains the central act of worship during every Catholic Mass.</p>
    <p>Confirmation strengthens the grace received at Baptismm and deepens our bond with the Church. Acts 8:14–17 tells of the apostles laying hands on the faithful. Symbols include chrism oil and the laying on of hands. It is usually received by teenagers growing into mature members of the Church.</p>

    <h2>Sacraments of Healing</h2>
    <p>Reconciliation, or Confession, offers forgiveness through God's mercy. Based on John 20:22–23, it includes a priest’s absolution. It is usually done privately and helps with spiritual growth.</p>
    <p>Anointing of the Sick offers spiritual and sometimes physical healing. James 5:14–15 instructs the sick to be anointed. The sacrament is given before surgery, during illness, or near death.</p>

    <h2>Sacraments of Service</h2>
    <p>Holy Orders ordains men to serve as deacons, priests, or bishops. Based on Luke 22:19 and John 20:21, the rite includes the laying on of hands and chrism oil. It requires spiritual formation and lifelong commitment.</p>
    <p>Matrimony is the lifelong union of a man and woman. Mark 10:6–9 highlights God’s role in joining couples. The ceremony includes rings and vows. Matrimony is lived out daily through love, sacrifice, and family life.</p>

    <h2>Creative and Critical Reflections</h2>
    <p>A catechist shared, “The sacraments are how I feel God touching my life,” while a student reflected, “Confession helped me heal from something I kept inside for years.” These testimonies show the sacraments' deep impact. An infographic or timeline can show when sacraments are received and their scriptural roots.</p>
    <p>The sacraments remain relevant today because they offer grace and direction. They shape Catholic identity and are meaningful even to non-Catholics who study them. Some sacraments, like Confession and the Eucharist, are often misunderstood. Confession is a moment of healing, not
